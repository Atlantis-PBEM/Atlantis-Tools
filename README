These scripts were written by JT Traub for running the "Realms of
the Arcane" and "Wyreth" Atlantis games on dragoncat.net.  They
were stored in the files section of the atlantisdev development
list, but now they're moving to github to be with the source.
I (Stephen Baillie, stephen.baillie@gmail.com) have updated them
to work with newer versions of Python, and have added a couple of
things for my own use in the process - particularly making the
timezones for game run be config variables rather than hardcoded,
and expanding the range of game run frequencies supported.

If you want to use this yourself, here's what I did to get it all
up and running - you may like to do the same :-)

* Created havilah.py (for my Havilah game) by copying default.cfg
  and changing the appropriate variables therein
* The scripts expect a number of directories and files to already
  exist, while they will create others.  Working out which was
  which was a bit of a process of trial and error, but here's
  what worked for me:

Created the gamedir directory (as defined in the config file)
Built gameexe
Created curdir and generated game.in and players.in inside it
  by using the "new" option to gameexe
Created the archdir and filedir directories
Created welcome.txt inside filedir - this is the message that
  will be sent to new factions when they are created, and should
  welcome them and refer them to any game-specific mailing lists
Created the htmldir directory and put a rules.html file created
  using gameexe's "genrules" option there, along with the
  supporting css file.
Created a "times" directory within htmldir

Got email to be forwarded to the dispatcher script by making my
  ~/.forward file contain:
| "~/scripts/dispatcher.py havilah"

Added a couple of cron jobs to run the reminder and runturn scripts:
0 15 * * * ~/scripts/reminder.py havilah
0 17 * * * ~/scripts/runturn.py havilah

(modify as appropriate for your game run times and directory paths)
Technically the reminder script shouldn't be run until the runturn
script has run at least once, but the resulting error is
inconsequential and it all sorts itself out.
